# Etx Geo Fence

The GeoJSON representation of geofence. Geofence supports the following geometry types: LineString, Polygon, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. The system only supports a single Feature in the FeatureCollection, so only one Line, Polygon, MultiLine or MultiPolygon can be defined within one Geofencing configuration.
